-- Project Amuse 2 --
A Finals Project for Programming II

First made using C++, this is an 'upgraded' version of
my very own quiz game created back when I was in my second college.

This version focused heavily on exploring the use of databases in
.NET applications.

Features:
- DB connections facilitated by OleDb
- DB provided by MS Access
- various features usually found in games, including:
	- login screen
	- registration
	- game dashboard
	- score rankings (not implemented)
	- game modes
	- game timer
	- game effects (HP drain, sudden death, etc.)
- Total of 100+ questions (this is a quiz game)
- Self-made graphics

Credits to:
Prof. Leo Alejandro
- for making us create the game in C++; much has been learned!

Prof. Ej Muyot
- for making us create a game of our own design and execution; again, much has been learned!
